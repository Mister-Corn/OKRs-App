## Misc Notes

### Evaluating OKR Results
	
  * Less than favorable
    
    Remember, OKR's are **not** personal evaluations.

    If you consistently fall short of at least 0.7 in your key results,
      * consider blockers that prevent you from realizing your Objectives
      * adjust your key results and objective accordingly
      * you can use blockers to formulate new objectives and key results
        Solving problems helps you achieve objectives, so look at lower than expected KR scores as opportunities to identify new objectives and KRs!
